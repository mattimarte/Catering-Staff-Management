# Catering Staff Management System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **Software Engineering** lifecycle, from requirements analysis to technical implementation. The goal was to design and develop a robust system for managing staff assignments and workflows within a catering company.

The project emphasizes **Object-Oriented Design (OOD)** and follows formal software engineering methodologies to ensure scalability and maintainability.

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java
* **Methodology:** Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)
* **Modeling:** UML (Unified Modeling Language)

## Software Engineering Artifacts
The development followed a rigorous design process. The repository includes documentation for:
* **Requirements Analysis:** Detailed User Stories and Use Case workflows (Success scenarios, extensions, and exceptions).
* **Structural Modeling:** Domain Models and Design Class Diagrams (DCD).
* **Behavioral Modeling:** System Sequence Diagrams (SSD) and Detailed Sequence Diagrams (DSD).
* **Contracts:** Formal Operation Contracts for system events.

## Key Concepts Applied
* **GRASP Patterns:** Implemented Information Expert, Creator, Low Coupling, High Cohesion, and Controller patterns to ensure high-quality software architecture.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Distinct logic handling between the domain model and the application controllers.
* **Robustness:** Handling of alternative flows and exceptions as defined in the Use Case extensions.
